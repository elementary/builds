This repository contains the website code for our Early Access builds. This
**DOES NOT** build elementary OS or have any operating system related code.

---

### Building & Testing
This site is built with Nuxt.JS, a Vue.JS framework.

You'll need the following dependencies:
* nodejs >= 10.20.1
* npm

Run `npm` to install additional packages and start the development server

```sh
npm ci # Installs additional dependency packages
npm start # Starts the web server
```

A link to the test server will appear in Terminal. (Typically this is `http://localhost:3000/`)
