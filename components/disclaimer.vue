      These are <strong>pre-release</strong> daily development builds of elementary OS.
      Current major known issues include, but are not limited to:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Installation failures while installing offline or with full-disk encryption</li>
      <li>Session defaults to GNOME; user must choose Pantheon from greeter</li>
      <li>Curated apps are not available in AppCenter</li>
      <li>Look &amp; feel issues, including unfinished dark style support</li>
      <li>General features and APIs are <strong>not finalized</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Please see the
      <a href="https://github.com/orgs/elementary/projects/55" rel="noopener" target="_blank">6.0 Release GitHub Project</a>
      for a full list of outstanding tasks and regressions.
    </p>

    <p>
      These issues, and more, are expected to be resolved before a stable release of elementary OS 6.
      Until that time, <strong>do not use these images on a production system</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Please refrain from publishing reviews or other in-depth looks of early access builds.</strong>
      We're excited that you're excited, but formally presenting unfinished products can damage our reputation. If you'd like to share informally, we'd appreciate a focus on features rather than quality or performance, which will change before release.
