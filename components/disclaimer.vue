      These are <strong>pre-release</strong> daily builds of elementary OS.
      Things will be broken. Please see the
      <a href="https://github.com/orgs/elementary/projects/55" rel="noopener" target="_blank">6.0 Release GitHub Project</a>
      for a full list of tasks and regressions. Current major issues with these
      images may include, but are not limited to:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>May require Internet to install</li>
      <li>Full-disk encryption may lead to a non-bootable install</li>
      <li>Curated apps are not available in AppCenter</li>
      <li>Dark style support is unfinished</li>
      <li>System stylesheet is unfinished</li>
      <li>General features, APIs are <strong>not finalized</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      While these issues are expected to be resolved before a stable release of
      elementary OS 6, their existence now and the generally unfinished state
      mean <strong>do not use these images on a production system</strong>.
