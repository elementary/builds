      These are <strong>pre-release</strong> development builds of elementary OS.
      They are not human-tested and may contain major issues. <strong>It will
      not be possible to upgrade</strong> to the stable release from these builds.

    <p>
      <strong>Please refrain from publishing reviews or other in-depth looks of early builds.</strong>
      We're excited that you're excited, but formally presenting unfinished products can damage our reputation. If you'd like to share informally, we'd appreciate a focus on features rather than quality or performance.
